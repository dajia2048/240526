<p>There is a feeling I search for: <em>being in good hands</em>. It is the feeling I look to give and the feeling I look to receive.</p>
<p>I know I am in good hands when I sense a cohesive point of view expressed with attention to detail.</p>
<p>I can feel it almost instantly. In any medium. Music, film, fashion, architecture, writing, software. At a Japanese restaurant it’s what <em>omakase</em> aims to be. I leave it up to you, chef.</p>
<p>When I am in good hands I open myself to a state of curiosity and appreciation. I allow myself to suspend preconceived notions. I give you freedom to take me where you want to go. I immerse myself in your worldview and pause judgement.</p>
<p>I want to be convinced of something new. I want my mind to be changed. Later I may disagree, but for now I am letting the experience soak in.</p>
<p>That trust doesn’t come easily. As an audience member it’s about feeling cared for from the moment I interact with your work. It’s about feeling a well-defined point of view permeate what you make.</p>
<p>If my mind was changed, I must have been in good hands.</p>
