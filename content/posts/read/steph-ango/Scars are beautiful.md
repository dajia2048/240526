总结:
这篇文章描述了作者在观看石内都雅子的摄影展览时被她的系列作品《疤痕》所震撼。摄影作品展现出的疤痕边缘蜿蜒曲折，不规则的褶皱使得照片散发出迷人的魅力。作者同时提到了有关日本哲学“wabi-sabi”的观点，即对瞬间美的赞美，并通过修复破碎陶器的金饰技术"kintsugi"来强调破裂的美。作者强调了疤痕和破裂都能讲述故事，它们代表了坚持和生存，而在我们对美的理解中，我们往往忽视了这个观点。作者认为欣赏瞬间美、不完美和疤痕有助于减轻焦虑，走向最多学习机会的道路。 <div>
<p>I saw a wonderful exhibit of Ishiuchi Miyako’s photography. Her series “Scars” particularly struck me.</p>

<p>The images are hard to look at without wincing. The oversized prints were even more painful to witness in person. But after the initial shock washed over me, I began to appreciate the photography itself. There is beauty in these shapes.</p>
<p>Like a path winding through a forest, I get lost in the meandering edges of these scars, the delicate unevenness of each wrinkle. As I separate myself from the pain, there is an intriguing nature to these photographs that is undeniable. I find it impossible to look at these images without questioning the fetishism of perfection ingrained in us since youth.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by the Japanese philosophy <em>wabi-sabi</em>. It is a worldview centered around the beauty of transience. An example is <em>kintsugi</em>, the art of repairing broken pottery by joining the pieces together with gold lacquer. By doing so, the cracks are accentuated rather than covered up or discarded. The object becomes more valuable as it loses its “perfection”.</p>

<p>Cracks, like scars, tell a story. They are not only beautiful to look at, they are also lessons in survival and perseverance.</p>
<p>There is no learning, no victory, no good story without a share of failures, scars, and the perseverance it took to overcome them. Too often we overlook that idea in our perception of beauty.</p>
<p>Wabi-sabi does not have to be fatalistic. The appreciation of imperfection is not an invitation to let things break down and dilapidate. The opposite of fragility is not resilience. Some things can be “antifragile” — they become stronger or better when challenged or exposed to chaos and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Many things in nature are antifragile. The muscles in your body are adapted to become stronger as they heal from being torn by physical exertion. Likewise, products and systems can be designed to not only withstand aging but improve over time.</p>
<p>I find that much anxiety can be alleviated by finding beauty in transience, imperfection, and scars. If we feel judged for our scars, we become afraid to get scarred. We follow the path that results in the least amount of pain, rather than the path that leads to the most amount of learning.</p>
<p>Whether they are literal or figurative, do not fear the scars. Be proud to earn them. Gild them like a kintsugi tea cup.</p>
