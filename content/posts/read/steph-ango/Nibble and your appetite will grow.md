<p>There’s a French expression I like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>L’appétit vient en mangeant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appetite comes when you eat. Nibble and your appetite will grow.</p>
<p>Appetite can be the hunger for any kind of thing, not just food. Some days I wish I had the appetite to write, to read, to exercise, or even go outside.</p>
<p>Procrastination is the state of waiting for motivation to come. Paradoxically, the most reliable way to create motivation is to start doing the thing.</p>
<p>Actions precede feelings. If you want to feel a certain way, create the environment that allows you to nibble your way there. Don’t hope that inspiration will come. Take a small bite. Action precedes inspiration, not the other way around.</p>
<p>If you nibble <a class="internal-link" href="https://stephanango.com/a-little-bit-every-day">a little bit every day</a> you can grow your appetite for bigger things. Entire fields and complicated projects. You can acquire a taste for things that today seem too hard, too big, too foreign. Nibble.</p>
