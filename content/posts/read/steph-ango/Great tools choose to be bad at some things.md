<p>Tools convert something you <em>can</em> do into something you <em>want</em> to do.  A pencil converts hand movements (what you can do) into markings on paper (what you want to do) with the purpose of conveying an idea.</p>
<p>New tools cause revolutions when they make costly things cheap. But making something cheap usually means making something else more expensive.</p>
<p>The design space is in axes of difficulty that can be flipped. It’s okay to make one thing harder if you can make something else much easier. <a class="internal-link" href="https://stephanango.com/design-is-compromise">Design is compromise</a>.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what can you afford to make more costly?</p>
<p>3D modeling tools make it easy to rotate objects, play with different perspectives and textures — all of which would be expensive to do with 2D drawings. The cost is that you need to create that 3D model and expend resources to render the final output.</p>
<p><a class="internal-link" href="https://stephanango.com/synthography">Synthography</a> makes it easy to render entire scenes and ideate across styles. The cost is that the output is flattened into a single layer and you have limited control over individual elements of the scene.</p>

<p>Resist criticizing tools for what they are bad at. Resist designing tools that are well-rounded. Instead, choose to be bad at something.</p>
