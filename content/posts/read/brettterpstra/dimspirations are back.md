<div> #dimspirations, automation, wallpaper, gallery, feedback
总结:<br/><br/>作者创建了一个名为#dimspirations的系列“inspirational”海报，并自动化了壁纸格式的创建。作者考虑建立一个易于维护的网站来展示这些作品，并考虑通过Patreon等方式获取支持。读者被邀请分享反馈和建议。 <div>

<p>I’ve started creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dimspirations/">Dimspirations</a> again, my depressing-but-actually-realistic collection of “inspirational” posters. You can follow the hashtag #dimspirations on Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, or Instagram for new posts. I’ve also automated the process of creating wallpaper-formatted version of them which get <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/circlesixdesign/albums/72157697001065435">uploaded to Flickr</a> and are also <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/otherstuff/wallpaper/">available as a zip</a> (containing 5120x3200 and 2048x1366 versions). I should probably add an iPhone ratio to the automation, but they get harder to resize vertically from one image. Anyway, if you’re in the mood to be “dimspired,” check them out.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’ve never checked it out, the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/otherstuff/">“Other Stuff”</a> section (where my wallpapers are located) has some fun projects in it. Fun for me, anyway.</p>
<p>Side tangent: I own the domain dimspire.me, and have always meant to find a way to make an easy-to-maintain gallery out of these. Probably a blog-style thing with daily or weekly dimspirations, with basic comments functionality and links to download the square or wallpaper versions. The index page would just be a thumbnail gallery with the main image from each post. It might actually be nice to do a paywall and have the wallpaper versions supported by Patreon or something. I don’t know if anyone would actually pay for these. I’ve seen similar projects sold as books, and I feel like the designs are actually pretty good for print, so maybe someday. Anyway, my inclination is to do this site in Jekyll (which I’m very adept at), but would be open to any suggestions as to what the best way to accomplish this would be. I’m not even opposed to WordPress with some custom plugins (which I’m also surprisingly adept at), which would be pretty easy to automate and then I could use MarsEdit to maintain it. Still pondering.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please share your feedback (and any suggestions, should the dimspiration strike)!</p>
