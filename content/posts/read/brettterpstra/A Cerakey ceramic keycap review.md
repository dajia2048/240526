<div> ceramic keycaps, backlit, sound, pros and cons, personal experience <br/>
<br/>
总结: 这篇文章介绍了作者购买陶瓷键帽的经验。键帽在背光下呈现出独特的外观，但字体在背光下比较难辨认。此外，键帽的声音也有所改变，失去了原本机械键盘的特有“咔嗒”声。作者个人认为这是个人取向的问题。总之，作者对陶瓷键帽的使用体验较为满意，但也提到了一些改进的空间。 <div>
<p>I recently purchased some <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/">Cerakey</a> ceramic keycaps for my <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a>. When I mentioned the purchase on Mastodon, I got a few replies asking for a review, as multiple people had been considering the purchase. So here it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I have 3 cats. I tried to clean the keyboard up as much as possible before I took photos, but if you have cats, you know how that can go. I did my best.</p>

<h3 id="the-look">The Look</h3>
<p>Here’s how the keys look sans backlighting:</p>

<p>I originally ordered the <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/products/full-set-v2?variant=41532871508107">“Crazed” keycaps</a> (pictured below), but after paying for them I was notified that there was an error between actual stock and what Shopify listed, so instead they sent me <em>two</em> sets, in Canal Blue and Water Blue. So I combined them, as seen above. The Q–R keys of the left half are Canal Blue, the right half is Water Blue.</p>
<p>I really like the crackled look of the Crazed keys, so I might order those in the future when they’re back in stock:</p>

<p>One nice thing about ceramic keycaps is the way they glow when backlit. If you don’t have a backlit keyboard, you’ll only be concerned with the sound and weight, which I’ll detail below. But if you have backlighting:</p>

<p>Unlike shine-through keycaps, the legends are actually harder to read when backlit. I’m a touch typist and never look at my keys, so it’s kind of a moot point for me. The only time I need to look at the keyboard is when I’m typing a number without my fingers on the home row (e.g. 2FA auth code when I’m also holding my phone). If you hunt and peck <em>and</em> have a backlit keyboard, you might want to think twice.</p>
<p>Seriously, the overall aesthetic of backlit ceramics is (to me) the coolest I’ve seen. This will depend on personal preference, and there are plenty of backlighting setups I’ve never tried, but:</p>

<p>The keys have a shine to them. They look like a polished plastic. I guess they look like what you’d expect a laquered ceramic surface to look like. I find it pleasing, but again, it’s going to depend on personal preference.</p>
<p>If you like multi-colored keyboards, you’re going to drop some cash as Cerakey only sells full sets in one color. I would love it if you could combine colors to create a custom layout. I would also appreciate being able to get single custom keys, as the UHK has a very <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/layout-and-keycaps">unique layout</a> that no standard keycap set will cover. While I was customizing, I went ahead and ordered the 1.75U space bars that the UHK uses <a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-artisan">from Asymplex</a> (h/t <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BrokenFlows">@BrokenFlows</a>).</p>
<h3 id="the-sound">The Sound</h3>
<p>My box white switches with ceramic keys have less click, which at first blush is a con to me. I picked the box white switches for my UHK because they had what I found to be the perfect amount of clickiness with PBT keycaps. The ceramic keys remove most of the click, and replace it with a pretty bassy thock. I’m currently deciding whether that’s a compromise I’m willing to make, or whether I’m going to swap them out for blue switches (or go back to PBT keycaps).</p>
<p>To be fair, hit softly and one-at-a-time, they still click just fine. It’s just the thunder of rapid-fire typing that lacks the click I find so satisfying on my mechanical keyboards.</p>
<p>Here’s how the ceramic keycaps sound on my UHK with Box White switches:</p>
<figure class="audio"><audio controls="true"><source src="cdn.g0f.cn/?r=https://brett.trpstra.net&url=https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/cerakey-on-box-white.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/><source src="cdn.g0f.cn/?r=https://brett.trpstra.net&url=https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/cerakey-on-box-white.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>HTML5 audio not supported </audio><figcaption>"Cerakey on Box White" </figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s how the original PBT keycaps sound:</p>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>I would consider the loss of click a con, but that’s an entirely personal opinion. As described above, Cherry Blue switches actually sound pretty good. Basically like Box White switches with PBT keycaps.</p>
<p>The one thing that does bug me is there’s no discernible bump on the F and J keys, so I do have to look down to find the home row. I’m going to fix this with a home brew solution, eventually. Maybe a little epoxy and some <a href="https://amzn.to/3SLSGs6">Sugru</a>. Most glues and resins won’t stick to the ceramic surface, so this is going to take a little work. I don’t have feeling in the tips of my fingers on my right hand (I don’t know why, this only happened in the last 10 years), so I need a big bump to be able to feel it. This is probably less of a problem for others, but in recent years it’s taken a little customization for me, even when there <em>are</em> ridges on the F and J.</p>
<p>The harder-to-read legends on backlit ceramic keys is a little bit of a bummer. As I said above, it doesn’t really affect me, but it might be something to note.</p>
<h3 id="neither-pro-nor-con">Neither Pro Nor Con</h3>
<p>The keys are slippery. This is kind of a non-issue, it turns out. I thought the slick surface of the keys would affect my typing speed and error rate, but it really doesn’t. If anything I actually type a little faster on these, but it’s a negligible difference.</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
<p>I’m going to use these for a couple months and see if I miss the PBT keys at all. So far I don’t, and I love the look. I <em>would</em> like to get the <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/products/full-set-v2?variant=41532871508107">Crazed</a> version eventually, but I’ve spent enough money on keycaps for a while. I’ll eventually want to replace the modifier keys, but will have to find a custom solution for those.</p>
<p>I have to decide how important the click I was used to is. I’m finding the overall sound of these pretty pleasing after a few days with them. But my modifier keys and space bars are still PBT, so I hear the click after every word. This makes the difference obvious, but also gives me a certain amount of satisfaction that might tide me over.</p>
<p>I hope this helps answer some questions. I take no responsibility for your purchase, but now you have the benefit of my experience.</p>
