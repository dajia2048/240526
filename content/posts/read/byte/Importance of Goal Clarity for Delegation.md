<div> Summary: 在文章中，作者提到了75/25规则，即如果你对某个项目/任务的执行者正确执行的可能性约为75%，那么就可以进行委托。剩下的25%空间是为了让该人学习、探索、犯错误、创新和成长。
如果决定委托项目/任务，接下来会发生什么呢？
目标清晰
作者在委托工作时面临的一个常见挑战是，在交付工作后，结果往往是不可预测和无法控制的。这种非结构化的方法经常让我思考如何通过减少委托范围来减少未完成风险，并且给被委派者带来了困惑，不知道他们应该如何进行。
来自《Who not How》一书的一点信息提供了解决这个问题的指导和结构：

(…) 研究发现，团队在具有高度自治但目标不明确以及缺乏绩效反馈的情况下，表现比低度自治的团队要差。
据上述研究称，具有高度自治、目标明确和定期反馈结果的团队的表现会飙升。
除了定期反馈外，目标清晰非常重要，尽管听起来很明显，但在委托过程中可能会被忽视和淹没。
实践中的明确性
在意识到上述问题后，对于每个委托的工作，我把明确预期结果、服务完成的定义、重要的里程碑和截止日期、什么时候应该向我汇报问题以及每个参与者的责任作为首要任务。
所有上述内容都以明确而简洁的方式进行沟通，并且最好以公开文件形式进行记录，以增加问责性和减少歧义（根据情况，仅口头沟通这些可能已经足够，特别是对于简单的任务）。
委派公式
基于以上情况，委派公式如下：
委派 = [75/25规则 -&gt; 目标明确 + 自主权 + 定期反馈] <div>
<p>Previously, in <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/2022/03/22/learnings-software-engineer-techlead.html">“Learnings as a Software Engineer Techlead”</a>, I’ve alluded to the 75/25 rule, where if you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors, innovate and grow.</p>
<p>If the project/task was decided to be delegated, what comes next?</p>
<h2 id="clarity-of-goals">Clarity of Goals</h2>
<p>One common challenge I’ve confronted when delegating was how unpredictable and uncontrollable the results felt upon handing over the work. This unstructured approach often left me thinking how I could decrease the non-completion risk by diminishing the delegated scope, and created confusion on the delegatee side on how they could proceed.</p>
<p>One tidbit of information from the “Who not How” book provided the guidance and structure to unlock this issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(…) research has found that teams who have high levels of autonomy but low clarity goals, as well as little performance feedback, perform worse than teams with low autonomy.</p>
<p><em>― <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Not-How-Accelerating-Teamwork-ebook/dp/B0867ZJ151">Who not How, by Dan Sullivan with Dr. Benjamin Hardy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is claimed in the above research that teams which have high autonomy, high goal clarity and regular feedback on their results, were observed to have their performance shooting through the roof.</p>
<p>Apart from regular feedback, goal clarity is incredibly important, and even though it might sound obvious, it can be overlooked and drowned out on the process of delegation.</p>
<h2 id="clarity-in-practice">Clarity, in Practice</h2>
<p>After the above realization, I’ve made it a priority for each piece of delegated work to clearly define what was expected as an outcome, its definition of done, important milestones and deadlines, when should an issue be scaled to me, and which are the ownerships for each of the participants.</p>
<p>All of the above communicated in a clear and concise way, and preferably publicly documented to increase accountability and decrease ambiguity (depending on the situation, merely communicating these verbally might be enough, especially if the task is simple).</p>
<h2 id="the-delegation-formula">The Delegation Formula</h2>
<p>Given the above, the proposed formula for delegation is:</p>
<p><em>Delegation = [ 75/25 rule -&gt; Goal Clarity + Autonomy + Regular Feedback ]</em></p>
