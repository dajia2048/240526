<p>Inspired by <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html">Marco</a> and <a href="https://kevquirk.com/on-subscriptions">Kev</a>, here is the current state of my subscriptions. Any prices that were in dollars I've converted to GBP. Anything I pay for yearly I've divided by 12 and marked them as such.</p>
<h3>Miscellanea</h3>
<p>I pay for <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/">Apple One Premier</a> at £36.95 per month which includes Apple TV+, iCloud Storage, and Apple Music for me and my wife but I'll include it in the streaming section for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p>I have a 1Password Family account but I get this for free through my job.</p>
<h3>Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Netflix (£7.99 / month). We cheap out on this because it's mostly for my wife to watch old crime documentaries and the quality doesn't really matter</li>
<li>Disney+ (£10.99 / month). We don't actually pay for this, instead we use our Tesco Clubcard vouchers every three months instead.</li>
<li>Amazon Prime (£7.99 / month (paid yearly)). We don't so much pay for this as we just get it included because we want quick delivery.</li>
<li>Apple TV+, Apple Music (£36.95 / month).</li>
<li><strong>Total:</strong> £63.92 / month</li>
</ul>
<h3>Memberships</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getconnectedpro.co">Connected Pro/Relay FM</a> (£4 / month). Ad-free episodes with extra content for connected, bonus episodes and access to the Relay Discord.</li>
<li><a href="https://oneprimeplus.com/">Hemispheric Views One Prime Plus</a> (£4 / month). Bonus episodes, a newsletter, access to a members-only Discord channel, plus some dandy stickers. I <em>just</em> bumped this from $2 to $5 because I'm not convinced much of my $2 is actually reaching them once you account for fees and whatnot.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> (£4 / month). I build so many of my sites with Eleventy, it's a no-brainer.</li>
<li><strong>Total:</strong> £12 / month</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apps and Services</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">omg.lol</a> (£1.33 / month (paid annually)). My main use is the <a href="https://social.lol">Mastodon instance</a> but it has loads of stuff. Read <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/omg-lol-an-oasis-on-the-internet/">Blake's post</a> for a better overview than I could ever write.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8e1d8283bd20">Digital Ocean</a> (£12 / month). Hosting for this website and all my <a href="https://rknight.me/projects">side projects</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/IXCLSF">Fathom Analytics</a> (£11 / month). Analytics I use for my sites. Worth noting here I get ~$7/£5 back each month thanks to referrals so the actual price paid here is ~£6.</li>
<li><a href="https://bunny.net/?ref=b2i4y24apu">BunnyCDN</a> (£1 / month). Currently only using this to host the files for <a href="https://wegot.family/">We Got Family</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> (£2 / month (paid yearly)). The best Mastodon client on the Mac and iOS.</li>
<li><strong>Total:</strong> £25.33 / month</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grand Total</h3>
<p>£101.25 isn't too bad considering everything I'm getting for that. Not sure what conclusion to draw from this, nothing here I really need to cut. Maybe if it goes much higher I'll think about it some more.</p>
