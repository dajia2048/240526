<p>Welcome to the Knight club - RSS-only posts. <a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS club</a>.</p> <hr/> <p>Congratulations on subscribing via RSS, you get these bonus posts. Lucky you. Welcome to the Knight Club<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://rknight.me/feed.xml#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What am I going to post here? Not a clue to be honest but there are things that I want to talk about that don't need to be full posts. I might "release" these into the <a href="https://rknight.me/blog">main archive page</a> after a year or so, mostly for my own sanity of finding them.</p>
<p>It's two days before the end of 2023 so I want to write down what projects I plan to do in the next 12 months. I don't mind talking about what I'm working on but I don't think a "proper" blog post makes sense until I have something to release. Firstly, I have a couple of in progress projects I want to finish.</p>
<p>Meta checker (I will come up with a better name) is similar to <a href="https://metatags.io/">metatags.io</a> but more suited to the specific things I want to check for a website: favicon, Safari accent color, is the RSS feed auto-detectable, those kinds of things. It will serve as a checklist of sorts for when I'm nearly done with a project.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://echo.rknight.me/">Echo</a>. I want to make this a more friendly service for non-tech people to use. Right now it requires NodeJS knowledge, a horrible Javascript config file, and a pocket full of hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>Now for the new projects. The first is a GitHub-based CMS, similar to <a href="https://tina.io/">TinaCMS</a>. If you follow me on Mastodon, you'll know I've had <em>a lot</em> of issues with getting Tina set up. I'm not sure how their backend works but it is definitely more complicated than it needs to be. I think I can make something more suited to what I want and hopefully what other people want.</p>
<p>The second project has already been through multiple iterations: Almanac. A media logging website. Think Letterboxd but for everything: movies, TV shows, podcasts, music, books. I initially wanted to make this a service people signed up for and used but the licensing around the data just isn't worth the hassle. So instead, I'm going to make it a self-hosted, bring-your-own-api-keys site. It'll have a nice API to be able to update my <a href="https://rknight.me/now">/now page</a>, feeds to auto-post to Mastodon, and some other fun stuff. The API itself is done but I need to consider how I want the front end to work.</p>
<p>Finally, webmentions. How do they work? I <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/">wrote a post about it</a> and I'm still not entirely sure. I'm relying on <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> and <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a> but <em>how</em> do they work? I want to make my own thing to handle webmentions and conversation from Mastodon but I need to dig into the formats first.</p>
<p>That's it for now, have a great new years!</p>
