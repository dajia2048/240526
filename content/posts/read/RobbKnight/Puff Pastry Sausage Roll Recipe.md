<p>Here is the recipe for very easy to make sausage rolls. You'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>~450g of sausage meat. I prefer to buy sausages and remove the skin as there's a bigger variety of flavours available without having to add stuff to sausage meat myself</li>
<li>A sheet of puff pastry. In the UK at least these come in a standard size of 320g (<a href="https://groceries.asda.com/product/pastry-dough/jus-rol-puff-pastry-ready-rolled-sheet/910000468752">example</a>)</li>
<li>An egg</li>
<li>A baking tray and some greaseproof/baking paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°c. Whisk up an egg in a bowl.</p>
<p>Lay the puff pastry flat and lay a cylinder of sausage meat about an inch thick across the pastry. Roll the pastry around that and cut it so there's just enough to cover the meat with a little bit of overlap. Do this until you run out of pastry.</p>
<p>Grab your baking tray, lay down some greaseproof paper on it, then brush the tray with the eggwash.</p>
<p>Cut up your long sausage roll into inch-wide smaller sausage rolls and pop them on the baking tray, seam down. Brush them with egg and pop them in the oven for 20-25 minutes until they're golden brown all over.</p>
<p>Boom. Sausage rolls for days.</p>
